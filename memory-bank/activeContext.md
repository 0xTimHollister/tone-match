# Active Context

## Current Focus

The project is currently in the initial setup phase. We have successfully created a browser extension project using WXT with React and TypeScript. The core structure is in place, but we need to start implementing the specific functionality for tone analysis.

## Recent Changes

- Initialized the WXT project with React and TypeScript
- Set up the basic extension structure with popup, background, and content scripts
- Created the memory bank documentation system
- Configured the development environment with Bun

## Active Decisions

- **UI Framework**: Using React for the user interface due to its component-based approach and wide adoption
- **Type Safety**: Implementing TypeScript for better code quality and developer experience
- **Extension Structure**: Following standard browser extension architecture with popup, background, and content scripts
- **Package Manager**: Using Bun for faster installation and development experience

## Current Challenges

- Defining the specific tone analysis approach (local processing vs. API)
- Determining the best way to capture and analyze text from web pages
- Designing an intuitive UI for tone analysis results
- Ensuring cross-browser compatibility

## Next Steps

1. Implement basic text selection and capture in the content script
2. Design and implement the popup UI for tone analysis results
3. Develop a basic tone analysis algorithm or integration
4. Set up communication between content script and background/popup
5. Add user settings for customization
6. Test the extension on different browsers and websites
