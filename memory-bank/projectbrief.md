## Tech Stack

- WXT (Web Extension Tools) for browser extension development
- React for UI components
- TypeScript for type safety
- Bun as package manager and runner

## Project Structure

- `entrypoints/` - Contains the extension's entrypoints
  - `popup/` - The popup UI that appears when clicking the extension icon

  - `content.ts` - Content script that runs on web pages
- `assets/` - Static assets for the project
- `public/` - Public files for the extension
- `.wxt/` - Generated WXT files
- `memory-bank/` - Project documentation and memory bank

## Core Requirements

1. Create a browser extension using WXT, React, and TypeScript
2. Implement basic extension functionality with popup, background, and content scripts
3. Ensure proper documentation through the memory bank system

## Next Steps

1. Define specific functionality requirements for the extension
2. Set up the development environment and workflow
3. Implement core features
4. Test on different browsers
