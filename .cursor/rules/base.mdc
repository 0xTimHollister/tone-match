# Tone Match Project Rules

## Project Structure
- React components should be organized in the popup directory for the extension UI
- TypeScript is used throughout the project for type safety
- WXT handles browser extension-specific configuration
- Entry points include popup, background script, and content script

## Coding Patterns
- Use functional components with hooks for React
- Prefer const assertions for type safety
- Keep component files focused on a single responsibility
- Use CSS modules for component styling

## Development Workflow
- Run `bun run dev` to start the development server
- Run `bun run build` to create production build
- Memory bank should be updated with project progress

## Testing and Quality
- Test any changes on Chrome and Firefox
- Ensure responsive design for popup UI elements
- Follow consistent code formatting and style
- Document complex logic with comments

## Extension-Specific
- Content scripts should be non-intrusive to user experience
- Background scripts should handle heavy processing
- Popup UI should be intuitive and user-friendly
- Follow browser extension security best practices
